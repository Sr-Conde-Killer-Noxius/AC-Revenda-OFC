# AI Rules for Acerto Certo Application

This document outlines the core technologies used in this project and provides guidelines for using specific libraries to maintain consistency and best practices.

## Tech Stack Overview

*   **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides an instant development server and optimized builds.
*   **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions, improving code quality and maintainability.
*   **React**: A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **shadcn/ui**: A collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
*   **React Router**: A standard library for routing in React applications, enabling declarative navigation.
*   **Supabase**: An open-source Firebase alternative providing a PostgreSQL database, authentication, instant APIs, and real-time subscriptions.
*   **TanStack Query (React Query)**: A powerful library for managing server-side data fetching, caching, and synchronization in React.
*   **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
*   **Lucide React**: A collection of beautiful and customizable open-source icons.
*   **Sonner**: A modern toast component for React.

## Library Usage Rules

To ensure consistency and leverage the strengths of each library, please adhere to the following rules:

*   **UI Components**: Always use `shadcn/ui` components for building the user interface. If a required component is not available or needs significant customization, create a new component in `src/components/` that wraps or extends `shadcn/ui` primitives. **Do not modify files within `src/components/ui/` directly.**
*   **Styling**: All styling must be done using **Tailwind CSS** utility classes. Avoid using inline styles or creating separate CSS modules/files (beyond `src/index.css` for global base styles).
*   **Routing**: Use **React Router** for all client-side navigation and route management. All main application routes should be defined in `src/App.tsx`.
*   **Backend Interactions**: All authentication, database operations (CRUD), and real-time functionalities must be handled using the **Supabase** client (`@/integrations/supabase/client`).
*   **Data Fetching & Server State**: For managing server-side data, including fetching, caching, and mutations, use **TanStack Query**.
*   **Form Validation**: Implement all form and data validation using **Zod** schemas.
*   **Icons**: Use icons from the **lucide-react** library.
*   **Toast Notifications**: For displaying temporary, non-blocking messages to the user (e.g., success, error, loading), use the **Sonner** toast component.
*   **Utility Functions**: General utility functions (e.g., `cn` for class merging) should be placed in `src/lib/utils.ts`.
